# Final

#Where the code is hosted
#The code for my final project/game is hosted on GitHub.  The repository is public, so anyone is able to access the files.

#External services
#None.

#Languages and technologies
#This program was made entirely in Python, using Thonny.  There were no other programs used in the making of this project.

#System requirements 
#The only requirement to run this file is access to a Python compiler.  Any Python IDE or web-based Python compiler.

#Coding/naming conventions
#The coding/naming conventions used in my project are fairly straight forward.  There is an “L” list that acts as an inventory.  It contains the crew members that you are able to recruit for your mission.  This list also keeps track of whether or not the player has fueled up their spacecraft.  There are CH1-5 inputs throughout the program to record the users’ responses.  These correspond with their respective chapters.

#An overview of the architecture
#I used the example posted on D2L as a template for the layout of my program.  Each chapter has a fairly similar structure.  As someone who is fairly new to Python, I am sure there are improvements that could be made to improve its efficiency.

#How to start the program
#To start the program, you simply run the script on any Python IDE application or through a Python compiler on your web browser.
